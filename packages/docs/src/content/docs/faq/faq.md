# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Capsule?

Capsule is a personal server platform that lets you own and control your digital space. It provides a way to store your data, run applications, and manage your online identityâ€”all under your control rather than on corporate platforms.

### How is Capsule different from cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox?

While cloud storage services let you store files online, Capsule is a complete personal computing platform. Beyond just storing data, Capsule allows you to run applications, automate workflows, and control who has access to your information. Most importantly, you control the infrastructure, so your data isn't being analyzed or monetized by a third party.

### Is Capsule open source?

Yes, Capsule is fully open source. You can view the code, contribute to it, or even modify it for your own needs. We believe in transparency and community collaboration.

- People concerned about privacy and data ownership
- Developers who want to build personal tools without corporate constraints
- Self-hosters who prefer to run their own services
- Anyone tired of constantly changing terms of service and feature removals
