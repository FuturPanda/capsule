# The Capsule Philosophy

## Digital Sovereignty for Everyone

Capsule was created with a foundational belief that individuals should have complete control over their digital lives. In an era where giant tech corporations control our data, communications, and online identity, Capsule offers an alternative path—one where you own your digital future.

## Core Principles

### 1. Your Data, Your Control

We believe your personal data belongs to you alone. Capsule gives you full ownership of your information, allowing you to decide what data you store, where it's stored, and who can access it. Unlike centralized platforms that monetize your information, Capsule keeps your data under your exclusive control.

```
Your digital life shouldn't be a product to be sold or mined for insights.
```

### 2. Simple but Powerful

Technical complexity shouldn't be a barrier to digital sovereignty. Capsule is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise, while still providing powerful capabilities for those who want to extend it.

Our approach balances simplicity with flexibility, offering intuitive interfaces for everyday users alongside robust tools for developers who want to create custom solutions.

### 3. Open by Design

Capsule is built on open-source principles, ensuring transparency in how your data is handled. We believe critical infrastructure should be inspectable, modifiable, and community-supported.

This openness creates a foundation of trust that closed systems can never achieve. It also empowers a community of creators to extend and enhance the platform in ways we never imagined.

### 4. Private by Default

Privacy isn't just a feature—it's the starting point. Capsule is designed from the ground up with privacy as a core value, not as an afterthought.

Your Capsule doesn't track your behavior, doesn't sell your attention to advertisers, and doesn't build profiles about you. It's a space where you can exist digitally without constant surveillance.

### 5. Sustainable Digital Presence

We're building for the long term. Your digital life shouldn't depend on the business decisions of massive corporations or the funding cycles of startups.

Capsule aims to create a sustainable approach to personal computing that can evolve with you over time, allowing you to maintain control of your digital identity and data for decades, not just until the next acquisition or pivot.

## Why Capsule Exists

### The Problem with the Current Internet

Today's internet is dominated by centralized services that:

- Extract value from users through data harvesting and targeted advertising
- Create walled gardens that limit interoperability and choice
- Subject users to arbitrary changes in terms, features, and pricing
- Prioritize engagement metrics over user wellbeing
- Provide "free" services that come with hidden costs to privacy and autonomy

### Our Alternative Vision

Capsule represents a different path forward:

- **Self-sovereign computing**: Control your digital identity and data without intermediaries
- **User-centric design**: Built to serve your needs, not extract value from you
- **Portable personal data**: Take your information with you across services and devices
- **Extensible platform**: Create or install capabilities that serve your specific needs
- **Community governance**: Participate in shaping the future of the platform

## From Philosophy to Reality

These principles aren't just aspirational—they're embedded in how Capsule is designed and built:

- **Local-first architecture**: Your data lives on your infrastructure first, syncing elsewhere only when you choose
- **Transparent operation**: Open-source code and clear data handling practices
- **Standard protocols**: Built on established, open standards rather than proprietary formats
- **Developer-friendly**: APIs and tools that encourage extension and customization
- **Self-hosting options**: Deploy on your own infrastructure or a trusted provider

## Join the Movement

Capsule is more than just a product—it's part of a broader movement toward a more equitable, user-controlled internet. By using Capsule, you're not just choosing a tool; you're supporting a vision of digital life where individuals, not corporations, are in control.

We invite you to participate not just as a user but as a community member—contributing ideas, code, or simply spreading the philosophy of digital sovereignty to others who might benefit from it.

```
The future of computing should be personal again.
```
